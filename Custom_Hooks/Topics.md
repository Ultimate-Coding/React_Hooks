# Custom Hooks: Sharing logic between components

1. Custom Hooks let you share logic between components.
2. Custom Hooks must be named starting with use followed by a capital letter.
3. Custom Hooks only share stateful logic, not state itself.
4. You can pass reactive values from one Hook to another, and they stay up-to-date.
5. All Hooks re-run every time your component re-renders.
6. The code of your custom Hooks should be pure, like your componentâ€™s code.
