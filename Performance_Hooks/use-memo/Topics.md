# useMemo

useMemo is a React Hook that lets you cache the result of a calculation between re-renders.

# Returns

- On the initial render, useMemo returns the result of calling calculateValue with no arguments.

- During next renders, it will either return an already stored value from the last render (if the dependencies havenâ€™t changed), or call calculateValue again, and return the result that calculateValue has returned.

# What will we cover in this hook?

- Skipping expensive recalculations
- Skipping re-rendering of components
