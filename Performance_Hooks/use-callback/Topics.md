# useCallback

useCallback is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.

# Returns

- On the initial render, useCallback returns the fn function you have passed.

- During subsequent renders, it will either return an already stored fn function from the last render (if the dependencies havenâ€™t changed), or return the fn function you have passed during this render.

# What will we cover in this hook?

- Skipping re-rendering of components
- Updating state from a memoized callback
